\chaptermark{PREFACE}

The main content of the present volume is the science of electromagnetism and the science of waves (elastic, electromagnetic, and light).

The International System of Units (SI) has been used throughout the book, although the reader is simultaneously acquainted with the Gaussian system. In addition to a list of symbols, the appendices at the end of the book give the units of electrical and magnetic quantities in the SI and in the Gaussian system of units, and also compare the form of the basic formulas of electromagnetism in both systems.

The course is the result of twenty five year's work in the Department of General Physics of the Moscow Institute of Engineering Physics. I am grateful to my colleagues and friends for their helpful discussions, criticism and advice in the course of the preparation of the book.

The present course is intended above all for higher technical schools with an extended syllabus in physics. The material has been arranged, however, so that the book can be used as a teaching aid for higher technical schools with an ordinary syllabus simply by omitting some sections.
